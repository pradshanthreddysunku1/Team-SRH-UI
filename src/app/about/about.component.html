              <h3>Short Bio</h3>
              <p>I am a graduate student at Marist. The driving force for me to pursue the Master of
              Science in Computer Science is the evolution of programming languages, which are capable of inventing new technologies,
              and a strong desire to be a part of that, especially with a focus on research related to Programming, Databases, and
              Analytics. My passion for Computer Science is majorly a result of my graduation education and my job experience in the
              Information Technology field. I have gained valuable experience in multiple platforms like Databases, CI/CD, Scripting
              languages like Perl and Python, Unix shell scripting Web Services, Mobile Applications, Quality Assurance, and
              Functional knowledge across various domains. With the technical and domain experiences, now I want to fortify my skill
              set by pursuing a master's degree that would enhance my skills technically and add business skills to flourish in the
              Information Technology field.</p>
